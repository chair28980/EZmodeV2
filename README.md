**EzmodeV2** is a browser extension designed to automate some participation activities on [Pond0x](https://www.pond0x.com/). With version 4.2.0.694, this extension provides a seamless experience for users looking to optimize their mining and swapping operations with minimal manual intervention. Featuring a user-friendly control panel, detailed status tracking, and smart automation features, EzmodeV2 is your go-to tool for efficient Pond0x interactions.

-  **Wallet integration**: Note the extension does not connect to or interact with your wallet in any way. It does not create any non native Pond0x signatures or need your private key or seed phrase to function.
-  **Full Automation**: Note as the extension does not interact with your wallet. You will require an autoclicker or pyautogui sciprt in order to confirm the Pond0x wallet signatures. 

## Features

### Mining Automation
- **Auto-Mining**: Automatically starts mining sessions.
- **Manual-Mining**: Requires user action to start each mining session. Respects all user defined values within control panel.
- **Smart Claim**: Claims tokens based on a configurable threshold (e.g., 200M tokens) or when the hash rate drops to zero.
- **Enable or Disable "Claim + Wait"**: Mines, claims, waits a user defined number of minutes, and repeats.
- **Control Panel**: Toggle between Auto and Manual modes, claim anyway (force claim regardless of settings). pause/resume mining, enable or disable "Claim and Wait", adjust Claim Interval (how long will a session go before forcing a claim. Use to prevent expired sessions), toggle "Smart Claim" on or off, set "Smart Claim" amount in millions or billions, toggle "Error State Restarts" on or off (if miner loads in 100k, 1m, or 1.1m page will force refresh and start a new session).
- **Status Monitoring**: Continuously checks the global mining status via a hidden tab and updates the user interface accordingly. **This function has been bypassed in this branch.**
- **Summary Box**: Displays real-time stats including total claimed tokens, last claim, average claim time, and daily claim history.

### Swapping Automation
- **Auto-Swapping**: Automates token swaps on Pond0x's Solana swap page with customizable pricing in all modes. All functions are contained and set within a single moveable control panel.
- **Swap Modes**:
- - **Auto**: Will swap on the hard coded random referal link that is set on line 1642 of the content_autoswapper file. You can replace this with any referal link youd like by directly accesing the file after download.
- - **Referral**: After each successful swap One-way or a swap cycle in Two-way modes the page will automatically refresh and load a new random referral link. There is no memory for this function so it may duplicate links before completing the list. As of July 31, 2025 there are 1,522 unique refferral links. 
- **Swap Types**:
  - **One-way Swaps**: Swaps your chosen sell token into the buy token until sell token no longer has funds to cover the set swap value.
  - **Two-way Swaps**: Swaps will be made alternating your sell and buy tokens in a swap cycle creating a loop until one or the other no longer has funds to cover the set swap value. (example of one swap cycle: usdc>sol then sol> usdc). To do this the extension will scrub the buy amount displayed and use it as the sell amount after inputting the bought token as the new sell. Every swap cycle begins with the users predefined swap value.
- **Custom Pricing**: Preloaded at 0.01 this box allows you to set the sell amount (Important: This is not a value it is a count of the token being sold). No commas are needed to define larger numbers (Example: 1,000 should be entered as 1000). A single period is used to define smaller than 1 values (example 0.1).
- **Swaps Completed**: Counts the number of swaps completed by EzmodeV2. Resets to 0 once the browser is closed. (Important: this is not your Swap Manifest Count!)
- **Swap Frequency**: Adjust how often swaps occur (default: every 1 seconds).
- **Token Pair Selection**: Choose your sell and buy tokens (Preloaded options: USDC, SOL, wPOND, USDT, hSOL, PepeonSOL & wBTC) with an easy dropdown interface. Simply choose your pair and click the Update button to automatically load the Pond0x UI with your choices.
- **New Token Input**: You can add your own Solana tokens. Simply type in the token name and then the contract address in the defined boxes and click add. This will permanetly add the token to the selectable tokens in the sell and buy dropdowns.
- **Total Swap Count Checker**: Input your wallet address to fetch and display your manifest swaps.

### General Features
- **Notifications**: Receive alerts for mining status, claims, swaps, and errors.
- **Drag-and-Drop UI**: Move the control panel and summary box anywhere on the screen.
- **Stats Tracking**: Monitor claim counts, total claimed tokens, swap counts, and historical data.
- **Export History**: Export your claim history as a CSV file for record-keeping.
- **Error Handling**: Automatically reloads the page on detected crashes or stuck states to ensure continuous operation.

## Known Issues

- **Page Load Delays**: If the Pond0x page takes too long to load, the extension may timeout. It will attempt to proceed but some features might not work.
- **Invalid Unclaimed Values**: If the mining page shows invalid unclaimed values (e.g., “100k”, “1m”), the extension will reload the page to recover itself with no interation needed
- **Swap Button States**: If the swap button gets stuck (e.g., “loading…” or “pending”), the extension will reload the page after a timeout.
- **Network Issues**: The extension checks for network connectivity and reloads the page if disconnected.
